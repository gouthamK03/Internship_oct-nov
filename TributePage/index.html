      <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist who is credited with saving over a billion lives through his work on developing high-yielding wheat varieties. He is known as "The Father of the Green Revolution" for his contributions to increasing food production in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Born in Iowa in 1914, Borlaug studied agronomy at the University of Minnesota. After graduating, he worked for the United States Department of Agriculture and the Rockefeller Foundation, where he developed new wheat varieties that were resistant to diseases and could grow in harsh environments.</p>
      <p>Borlaug's work had a profound impact on agriculture in developing countries, leading to dramatic increases in food production. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his contributions to world hunger.</p>
